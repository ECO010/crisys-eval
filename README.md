CriSysEval is a software tool designed to assist security analysts in evaluating the safety risks within Industrial Control Systems (ICS) networks.  
It leverages a combination of attack pattern data, vulnerability information, and user-provided asset details to:
- Generate attack-defense trees, visualizing potential attack paths
- Calculate safety scores based on identified vulnerabilities and mitigations
- Provide insights and recommendations to strengthen OT infrastructure security
